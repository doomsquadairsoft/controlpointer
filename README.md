Airsoft Field Control Point State Manager


So you have an airsoft field, and you want to play a game using control points just like `<INSERT_VIDEOGAME_NAME_HERE>`. You can set up two flags at each of your control point, but there lies a problem, especially for large fields. When your players are shot and want to go to a control point to respawn, how do they know which control point is available for their team to respawn at?

This app solves the above problem by providing each player with a live map, indicating which team controls the various control points on the field. This way, the player simply needs to view their phone after they are shot, and they proceed to their choice of spawn points based on the live data the app displays to them.

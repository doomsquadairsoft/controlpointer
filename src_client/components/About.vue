        <h1>About DooM Squad Airsoft</h1>

        <p>Doom Squad Airsoft is an airsoft clan located in the Pacific Northwest, USA. We enjoy running around in the woods and shooting each other with plastic BBs in fast paced, semi-competitive war gaming. We often take ideas from video games such as Counter-Strike, Battlefield, Call of Duty, and apply them to custom airsoft games. Our games incorporate pyrotechnics, realistic props, special airsoft weapons, and computerized point tracking systems. We love this action pursuit sport and we are always looking to have more people come and play!</p>
